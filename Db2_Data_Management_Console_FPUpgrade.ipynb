    "## Update the 3.1.1 Console to Support IFrame Embedding\n",
    "One of the great features of the Db2 Console is the ability to use parts of the user interface as a microservice. In the 3.1 Db2 Console there are no restrictions on this capability. However this left the console open to a possible Clickjacking attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clickjacking\n",
    "Clickjacking, is a kind of security attack were a hacker uses an embedded IFrame to lure users into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the the top level page. Thus, the attacker is “hijacking” clicks meant for their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another application, domain, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid any possibility of this the 3.1.1 Db2 Console turns of the IFrame Embedding by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Safely allowing IFrame Embedding\n",
    "Fortunately there is a very safe way to re-enable IFrame Embedding when you move to 3.1.1. Instead of completely denying any requests to embed a page from the Db2 Console into another page, you can specify that any request must come from the same origin as the Db2 Console. In practice this means that as long as you are running your Web Browser or Jupyter environment on the same machine as the Db2 Console you will be able to safely use IFrame embedding without a risk of Clickjacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating the WebSphere Liberty dsweb settings\n",
    "To ensure that we can continue to use IFrame Embedding in the hands on lab, we need to update the bootstrap settings in the WebSphere Liberty component of the Db2 Console. Usually you don't have to even be aware that under the covers the Db2 Console is running on a WebSphere Liberty server. In this case we need to change a single configuration parameter:\n",
